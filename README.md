# JMM-causal-inference
Code for simulation and analysis of data using joint mixed models for causal inference.

The analysis method addresses unmeasured common causes (confounders) of a time-varying binary exposure and longitudinal continuous outcome. Data are simulated in R and analyzed in SAS. Causal effects are estimated using g-computation of the final model estimates.

Code is also included with the paper:
